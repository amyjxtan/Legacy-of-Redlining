# Legacy of Redlining

## Project Overview

This project uses data from the 1930s when the practice of redlining initially began and compares it to 2020 census demographic data to examine segregation in the present. It demonstrates how, almost 90 years later, there is segregation based on the Home Owner's Loan Corporation grade assigned to it back in the 1930s on the state, division, and regional levels. 

## Installation and Setup
### Codes and Resources Used

- **Editor Used:**  Anaconda
- **Python Version:** Python 3.11.5

### Python Packages Used

- **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `pyplot`, `seaborn`, `plotly (express)`
## Data
### Source Data
The data used in this project is `metro-grades.csv` from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/redlining), saved into the variable `redlining` in the notebook.
## Results and evaluation
Provide an overview of the results of your project, including any relevant metrics and graphs. Include explanations of any evaluation methodologies and how they were used to assess the quality of the model. You can also make it appealing by including any pictures of your analysis or visualizations.

## Future work
- Use GIS software to produce better and more accurate maps that would better reflect a metro-area that isn't forced into a particular state boundary.
- Pair this demographic data with HOLC grades with other issues such as food insecurity, social vulnerability, life expectancy, etc. 
- Map across time using census data from other years to examine how segregation patterns have changed across time.
